This page introduces the [Developer] tab in Excel.

It is possible that your environment does not have the settings described herein. Check and change the settings if necessary.


How to View the [Developer] Tab in Excel
----------------

In Excel, to develop macros using VBA, you must display the [Developer] tab on the Ribbon as follows. 

(This procedure is not necessary for the computers in the Information Processing Classroom, because the [Developer] tab is already displayed.) 

If the [Developer] tab is not displayed on your own or any other computer, perform this operation to display the [Developer] tab.

&#9312; Start [Excel].

&#9313; Click on [Options].
