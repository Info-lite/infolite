Relational operators
----------

The relational operators include the following:

-   `=` : equal
-   `>` : greater than
-   `>=` : greater than or equal to
-   `<` : less than
-   `<=` : less than or equal to
-   `<>` : inequality

It represents the relationship between the two operands, and the result is indicated as `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

For example, suppose “A1” has `10` and “B1” has `20`.” C1” and type `=A1 > B1` or `=A1 <> B1`. The results are as follows:

Arithmetic operations on characters
----------------

Suppose “A2” has `Taro` and “A3” has `Hanako`. Select “B3” and type `=A2 & “&” & A3` to get “B3” as `Taro & Hanako`. In the formula, always **enclose the string in quotation marks `”`**.
