Add one's signature
------------

Many mailers, including Microsoft 365, allow for the addition of signatures. A signature is a text that is automatically added when composing an email. By writing your affiliation, name, and contact details in this section, you can let the person to whom you send the email know that it is from you.

#### Create a signature

&#9312; From the gear symbol in the top right-hand corner of the Outlook top screen, open Settings - View all Outlook settings and select Create and Reply.

&#9313; Type the required information in the signature field.

Name the signature in the [Edit signature name] field. Type the signature in the field below it and select [+ New signature]. Under [Select default signature], set the name of the signature you have just set to both [For New Messages] and [For Reply/Forwards]. When you have completed your work, select Save.

#### Add a signature manually.

&#9312; Select [New mail] in the mailbox. With [Message] selected at the top of the compose window, click on the pen-and-paper icon on the right and select the required signature.

If there is extra line space in the inserted signature, the signature may be HTML. 
Hold the [Shift] key and press [Enter] to start a new line in the signature settings.


How to attach files
------------------

Files can be attached to emails. You may submit a class report as an attachment to an email, for example, so you must know how to do this.

&#9312; Open the compose mail screen and select the clip icon to the right of [Message].

&#9313; Select the file to send.

&#9314; The file is now attached. If an email is sent in this state, an attached file can also be sent to the recipient.
