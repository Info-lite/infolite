Button operation 
----------

When operating the mouse, lightly press and hold the buttons with your index and middle fingers. 

* Point 
    * Pointing refers to the process of moving the mouse cursor to align the arrow with an object on the screen. In the Start menu, pointing opens the submenus. You can also view the description of an icon by pointing at it. 
* Click 
    * Click is the action of pressing the left mouse button once. It is used to select an object or click a button on the screen. 
* Double-Click 
    * The action of quickly clicking the left mouse button twice is called “double-clicking.” It is used, for example, to open files. 
* Right-click 
    * The action of clicking the right mouse button once is called “right-clicking.” It is used to display a “pop-up menu” that selects the action to be performed on the target object. 
* Dragging 
    * Dragging is the action of pointing to an object, holding down the left mouse button, and then moving the mouse to release the button at a different location. It is used to move files and other objects. 


Wheel operation 
------------

With a mouse with a wheel, place your index finger on it and turn it lightly. 

* Scrolling 
    * Most software is configured to scroll the screen by turning the wheel up and down. This is used when viewing a web page that extends for a long time downward. 
* Click 
    * On some devices in the Computer Rooms, you can use the universal scroll mode by clicking the wheel. When using this mode, you can scroll the screen by moving the mouse back and forth, left and right. To release it, click the left button normally.
