Please note the following points regarding the use of the printer. 

* Each person is allowed to print **up to 20 pages per day**. 
* Color printing is not available. 
* To conserve paper, **print on both sides of the paper** and use **condensed printing**. 
    * For example, if you reduce two pages to one and print both sides, you can print a total of 40 pages on 20 sheets of paper. 
    * If you are unsure how to use the printer, please consult an open-access counselor (tutor). 
* There are several printers installed; therefore, please check which printer you will take a print from. 
* Please avoid leaving unnecessary paper due to printing errors, etc.
