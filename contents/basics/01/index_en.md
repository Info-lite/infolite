Computer Room system and usage
--------------------------------

The following is a brief explanation of the Computer Room system.

The four classrooms on the third floor of Building No. 1 (Rooms 320, 330, 340, and 350) are collectively called the “Computer Rooms.” These classrooms are used for information literacy and can be freely used for self-study when classes are not held. In addition, there is an Information Processing Self-study Room (Room 115) on the first floor of the Computer Center as a classroom for self-study when the Computer Room is not available. Furthermore, Room 306 on the third floor of Building No. 1 is for self-study with a personal computer, and Room 305 is for group meetings and study groups. Laptop computers are also available for rental.

Room 320 is a Mac environment. The PC installed in Room 320 is a Mac mini, which runs macOS. Please check the following page for information on how to switch between Mac and Windows environments in Room 320.

-   [How to switch between Mac and Windows](https://tmuner.cpark.tmu.ac.jp/tmuner/en/study/pc/mac/mac-riyou7.html)

Rooms 330, 340, and 350, as well as Room 115 and rental laptops have Windows environment.

Please refer to the following websites for information on the differences in the environments of each classroom, including computers and installed applications.

    -   [Computer Room](https://tmuner.cpark.tmu.ac.jp/tmuner/ja/study/pc.html)
    -   [Hardware configuration](https://tmuner.cpark.tmu.ac.jp/tmuner/ja/study/pc/kousei.html)
    -   [Software configuration (Win)](https://tmuner.cpark.tmu.ac.jp/tmuner/ja/study/pc/kousei-win.html)
    -   [Software configuration (Mac)](https://tmuner.cpark.tmu.ac.jp/tmuner/ja/study/pc/kousei-mac.html)
    -   [Windows user’s guide](https://tmuner.cpark.tmu.ac.jp/tmuner/ja/study/pc/windows.html)
    -   [Mac user's guide](https://tmuner.cpark.tmu.ac.jp/tmuner/ja/study/pc/mac.html)

In the Computer Room, you can perform the same tasks regardless of the type of OS or terminal you are using. For example, data created in the Windows environment and saved in My Documents can be opened from the Mac environment, and vice versa.

Classrooms open to self-study are not always the same. However, you should be aware that you can perform the same task in any classroom.


How to use classroom computers
----------------------

When using a classroom computer, students must first sign in. This section describes the basic operations and how to sign in and sign out when using Windows 11 environment. If you are in a Mac environment, please follow the instructions on the following page to switch to the Windows environment.

-   [How to switch between Mac and Windows](https://tmuner.cpark.tmu.ac.jp/tmuner/ja/study/pc/mac/mac-riyou7.html)

### Signing in and signing out

&#9312; Make sure the computer is turned on. Press any key to display the sign-in screen on the monitor, as shown in the following image:

{% screenshot signin_2.jpg "Sign-in screen" %}

&#9313; Enter your username and password, then click [→].

1.  Username: Student ID number
1.  Password: The one you filled out and submitted on your enrollment form (four alphabetic characters and four numeric characters).
1.  Sign in to: Make sure it is “SPCTMU.”

&#9314; After signing in to Windows, you will see a screen (desktop) that looks like this: Double-click the My Documents icon in the upper-left corner to open it.

{% appendix ../appendix/mouse.html "Reference Material: How to operate the computer mouse" %}

{% screenshot desktop_2.png "Desktop" %}

The folder My Documents contains the data you created with your computer. In the Minami-Osawa campus environment, including the Information Technology Classroom, each student is allowed to use up to 5 GB of data. If this capacity is exceeded, the computers may no longer function properly. Please delete unnecessary files after backing them up to a USB memory stick or other similar device.

&#9315; After completing the necessary tasks, click the Windows logo button at the bottom of the screen to display the menu, then click the human-shaped icon and select “Sign Out.”

{% screenshot signout_2.png "Sign out" %}

Before you begin using the computer, it will be signed out and returned to its default screen. Make sure to sign out after using the computer in the classroom.

### Notes on saving files

This explanation is based on a Windows environment (Windows 11). The operating system installed on the terminal varies from classroom to classroom, and the actual display screen may differ from the explanatory image.
In the Computer Room, “My Documents” data is saved on the file server, rather than the terminal. Therefore, regardless of which terminal you sign in from, you will all be connected to the same “My Documents” and able to continue working from any terminal.

**In the Windows environment, files saved to the desktop are deleted when you sign out. Make it a habit to save all your files in the My Documents folder.**

### Changing your password

To change your password for the Educational and Research Information System, access the [user menu](https://navi.tmu.ac.jp/).

※If you are unable to change your password through the user menu, please visit the password service counter on each campus.



Starting and exiting applications
----------------------

### Starting applications

An application is a type of software that is designed to serve a specific purpose when working with computers. This section describes how to launch and exit applications in Windows 11. In this case, we will use “Notepad” as an example. To open the menu, click the Windows logo at the bottom of the screen, then “All Apps,” scroll down to the “n” section, and select “Notepad.”

{% screenshot notepad_2.png "Launch Notepad" %}

When an application is installed on a computer, it is added to a menu. Therefore, when you want to use an application, you can do so from a menu.


### Exiting applications

There are two options for exiting an application. Either option is acceptable.

-   Click the <i class="fa fa-times"></i>button (closed) in the upper-right corner of the application window.
-   On the menu bar of the application window, click [File]-[Exit].

When you create data using the application, remember to save it before it exits.

Printing
----

The Computer Room is equipped with a monochrome laser printer. During open-access hours, each student is permitted to print up to **20 pages** of documents and assignments per day.

{% appendix ../appendix/print.html "Reference Materials: Printing Precautions" %}

How to refer to teaching and reference materials
------------------------

Class materials and reference materials can be accessed through kibaco.
Depending on the instructor, information regarding assignment submissions (content, due dates, and so on), class procedures, and other communications may be posted. The next time you come to class, sign in before the class begins and read through the following sites when you have time.

-   [kibaco](https://kibaco-d.tmu.ac.jp/portal/home)

Webpages related to the Computer Room can also be viewed off-campus (e.g., from home). TMUNER provides information on the university’s network and systems. Please check it frequently.

Typing practice
--------------

When using computers, there are numerous opportunities to type, including in Japanese. Here, you can practice typing. Please refer to the following page for more information on how to type in Japanese.

{% appendix ../appendix/japanese.html "Reference Materials: About Japanese input" %}

### Selecting a text editor

The following text editors are available for Windows: A text editor is used to edit files in which only text (kanji codes, ASCII codes, etc.) is (or is about to be) entered as data. For example, a file created by a word processor is not a text file because it contains information in addition to the text.

* [FUJITSU 実践！タッチタイピング](https://azby.fmworld.net/usage/lesson/keyboard/typing/)
  - There are three courses: basic, proficiency, and challenge. They can practice typing words, short sentences, long sentences, or numbers. Consequently, the number of characters you type, number of mistakes you make, and keys you have difficulty with are displayed; you can also check your passing score on the typing proficiency test.
　
* [e-typing](https://www.e-typing.ne.jp/)
  - There are three different practice modes: Romaji, English, and Kana, each with a level check to test skills. Consequently, the number of characters you input, number of mistakes you make, and keys you have difficulty with are displayed; you can even practice the problems you made mistakes on again.

### Exercises

This is a Japanese input practice using one of the editors mentioned above. Follow the instructions (or launch the editor of your choice) and type in the following questions 1–4 using the editor. Each of these questions has approximately 350 characters, and you should have approximately 10 minutes to type (depending on your instructor).
